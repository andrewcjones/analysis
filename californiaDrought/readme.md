## [Full Report](https://docs.google.com/document/d/13DUUH0yRBztU8hCNoiwQQCoa4h-ROq_o6VF9-ULpma0/edit?usp=sharing) 

**Research Question**: What is the relationship between areas with high droughts and that area's demographics?

This project is an analysis of all California counties and their drought data from 2015-2019 and their demographic data from the 2019 census. I explore if there is a relationship between these data points.

Data was pulled from these sources: 
* [U.S. Drought Monitor](https://droughtmonitor.unl.edu/)
* [U.S. Census](https://data.census.gov/cedsci/)
